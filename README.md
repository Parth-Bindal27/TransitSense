# TransitSense

🚍 TransitSense

TransitSense is a web-based public transport intelligence platform designed to help commuters make informed decisions before boarding buses, metros, or local transport.

It focuses on crowd visibility, route conditions, and timing awareness, presenting complex transport signals in a simple, commuter-friendly interface.

🌍 Why TransitSense?

Daily public transport users often face
Unpredictable bus and metro timings
Overcrowded vehicles and stations
No visibility into which route or vehicle is more comfortable
Poor last-minute decision support
TransitSense addresses this gap by visualizing route-level conditions and helping users compare travel options based on time, crowd, and comfort.
